# Mobile Parkinson's Prediction
#### Using mobile phone data to help predict and monitor Parkinson's Disease

## About
This project was brought about because of the Michael J. Fox Parkinson's Challenge in Spring 2013. I was unable to complete an entry in time but kept the data. Using what was learned from contest submissions and other research, I hope to build a competitive model to those already found.
